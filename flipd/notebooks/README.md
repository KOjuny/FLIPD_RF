# Notebooks

The notebooks in this folder include the following:

1. [Circle Experiment](./notebooks/circle_experiment.ipynb): This notebooks runs a simple training on a circle dataset and verifies that the model is able to learn the data distribution.
2. [Diffusion log probabilities](./notebooks/log_prob.ipynb): This notebook contains the code to verify that the log probability of diffusion models is sound and also has a decent runtime.
3. [Fokker-Planck LID estimation](./notebooks/fpk.ipynb): This notebook ensures that the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov LID estimator works correctly by showing plots on toy data.
4. [Closed-Form diffusion LID estimation](./notebooks/cfdm.ipynb): This notebook ensures that the closed-form LID estimator works correctly by showing plots on toy data.
5. [Manifold Datasets](./notebooks/manifold_datasets.ipynb): This notebook ensures that the manifold datasets are generated correctly and are visually appealing.
